            "An Authentic Indonesian Dish that is loved by most Indonesians."
        </h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Nasi Goreng</strong> is the popular Indonesian fried rice which is traditionally served with a fried egg. I love the unique dark brown, caramelised colour of the rice! It‚Äôs a simple recipe, you won‚Äôt need to hunt down any unusual ingredients, and it‚Äôs one of my favourite Indonesian foods ‚Äì and I‚Äôm betting you will love it too. üôÇ

            The literal translation of <em>Nasi Goreng</em> is ‚Äúfried rice‚Äù in Indonesian and Malaysian ‚Äì and that‚Äôs exactly what it is! It‚Äôs mainly rice with just a little bit of meat and just onion for the vegetables. The thing that distinguishes it from other Fried Rice dishes is the sauce which is made with kecap manis, a sweet soy sauce that stains the rice dark brown and caramelises the rice when it cooks.

        <ul>
            <li>2 small shallots (2 ounces; 55g), roughly chopped</li>
            <li>3 medium cloves garlic(‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª</li>
            <li>1 large fresh green chile, such as Fresno or Holland, stemmed and seeded, or 1 teaspoon sambal oelek, such as Huy Fong (see note)</li>

            Steps
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add half the shallots to a mortar and grind with the pestle until a coarse pur√©e forms. Add remaining shallots, followed by garlic, chile, and terasi (if using), grinding with the pestle until each ingredient is mostly incorporated before adding the next. The final paste should resemble thick oatmeal in texture. Alternatively, combine all spice paste ingredients in a small food processor and process until they form a paste.</li>
            <li>If using day-old rice, transfer rice to a bowl and break rice up with your hands into individual grains.</li>
            <li>Add rice to the wok and stir to coat with the spice paste. Add kecap manis and soy sauce. Stir and cook until rice is evenly colored and hot throughout. Season with salt and white pepper.</li>
