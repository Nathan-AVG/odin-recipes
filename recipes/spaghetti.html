            Spaghetti (Italian: [spaˈɡetti]) is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta.[1] It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum wheat semolina.[2] Usually the pasta is white because refined flour is used, but whole wheat flour may be added. Spaghettoni is a thicker form of spaghetti, while capellini is a very thin spaghetti.🍝

        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage, mushrooms, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic in hot oil until sausage is browned and crumbly, about 20 minutes; drain and discard grease.</li>
            <li>Stir tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and olives into sausage mixture; season with oregano, basil, and salt. Simmer mixture until flavors infuse, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a serving bowl; top with tomato-sausage sauce and Parmesan cheese.</li>
